    <h1>Andrew Brown! Where does he come from? Who is he?</h1>
 
    <p>To answer such a question, one must look into the depths of time, digging through archives of data. By googling Andrew Brown, we find this:
    
    </p>
    
    <a href="http://m.mlb.com/player/518500/andrew-brown" class="linkstyle">Andrew Brown-Professional Baseball Player!</a>
    
   
    <p>But Andrew Brown is a man of many hats. Not only is he a Professsional Baseball Player, he is also a Fitness Model.</p>
    
   
    
     <a href="http://www.andrewbrowninc.com/" class="linkstyle">I'm sexy and I know it!</a>
     
      <p>Will the real Andrew Brown please stand up? NYC born, New Jersey raised. I have a mean left hook from years of not pumping my own gas, but pumping my fist in the club. I have a healthy obsession with Batman, and I'm addicated to chapstick. I love to snowboard, mountain bike, and make people around me feel pretty awkward with my terrible jokes. 
      </p>
      <p>I've been in Colorado for about 3 months now, living with my Brother and  his Wife (and Dog) in Littleton. I will be moving to Boulder ASAP, which is more of a challenge then I orignally anticipated.
